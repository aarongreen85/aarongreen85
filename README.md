- 👋 Hi, I’m @aarongreen85. I'm a Senior Consultant at Red Hat.
- 👀 I’m interested in GitOps, Openshift, Ansible, and automating various other Infrastructure platforms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Openshift and all the different ways it can be installed and configured.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code that helps our industry continue its evolutionary path to code being the source of truth for everything. I'm a reformed infrastructure admin, through and through.
- 📫 Email me at aaron.green@redhat.com.
